## File Structure

Work-OS uses a date-based folder structure for organizing data:

```
$WORK_OS_BASE_DIR/
├── raw/
│   ├── 2026-02-08/
│   │   ├── sync-0943.md              # Sync at 09:43 AM
│   │   └── sync-1430.md              # Sync at 14:30 PM
│   ├── 2026-02-07/
│   │   └── sync-0930.md
│   └── ...
├── today.md
├── archive/
│   ├── 2026-02-07.md
│   └── weekly/
│       └── 2026-02-01_2026-02-07.md
└── follow-ups.md
```

**Key Points:**
- Each day has its own folder: `raw/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Sync files use 24-hour format: `sync-HHMM.md`
- Multiple syncs per day are supported
- All raw data for a specific date is self-contained and easy to archive/delete
